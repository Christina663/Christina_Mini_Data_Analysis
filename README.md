# Mini-Data-Analysis

Welcome to my Mini data Analysis project! 

Here we apply knowledge from STAT 545A to manipulate, visualize, tidy our statistical data sets. We perform 3 individual milestones doing research on 4 datasets provided.

We have three milestone folders and one output folder. Inside each milestone folder, there will be a finalized .md file containing the kniited outputs from the milestone project, an .rmd file of the source R code and corresponding result graph files. Inside the output folder we have csv file and binary file from milestone 3. The file structure are as follows:

Milestone Folders:
+ README
+ .rmd file
+ .md file
+ Figure subfolder

Output Folders:
+ Graph results

We can simply open up each file on Github to view its complete content. No need to run any code!
