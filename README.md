# Mini-Data-Analysis

Welcome to my Mini data Analysis project! 

Here we apply knowledge from STAT 545A to manipulate, visualize, tidy our statistical data sets. We perform 3 individual milestones doing research on 4 datasets provided.

There will be three finalized .md file containing the kniited outputs from each milestone. We can simply open up each file on Github to view its complete content. No need to run any code!
